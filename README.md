# VFloors360-Client

**VFloors360-Client** is the front-end component of the VFloors360 project, a 360-degree room visualization platform designed for immersive VR experiences. This module allows users to explore TPT's tile catalog in realistic virtual environments, such as kitchens and bathrooms, powered by WebXR, React, and Three.js.

## 🌐 Project Overview

VFloors360-Client provides users with an intuitive and interactive way to visualize various tile options in 3D-modeled rooms using Meta Quest 2 and compatible web browsers. It leverages `@react-three/fiber`, `three.js`, and `leva` to manage scenes, controls, lighting, and interactions.
